# Welcome!

## Hello!

Who am I?

. . .

Who are you?

-   What is your background?

-   Do you have experience with data analysis?

-   What's your attitude towards statistics?

```{=html}
<!-- . . .

Today, I'm feeling...

![](images/moodmeter_en.jpg){fig-alt="Moodmeter"} -->
```
::: notes
Survey (Zoom) + Moodmeter (pick a stamp - top of screen, select annotate...)

Too many people to have an introduction round!

I know that you probably don't know each other yet, there will be some break-out sessions where you can get to know each other a bit (and talk about stats!) ;)

Stats Anxiety: It will be packed, but it will be ok (You can always reach me with questions!)!
:::

## Using the Slides

-   These slides are created directly in R with the quarto extension.
-   You can jump to a slide by clicking the three dashes in the bottom left.
-   You can conveniently copy R code from the slides with one click and paste it into your RStudio.

```{r}
#| echo: true

print("Hello World")

```

## Organizational Issues

. . .

```{=html}
<!-- -   *Warning*: The course only lasts until mid-December - but we have to squeeze the content of the full semester in these 8 weeks!

    -   This means, we'll have two sessions per week, Statistics (Input) on Tuesdays and R Programming (Hands-on) on Wednesdays -->
```
-   Attendance is mandatory! (I don't make the rules :) )

    -   You may miss one session without giving reasons (recommendation: don't waste it early!)

    -   If you miss additional sessions, please write an email with an explanation (further proof may be required, e.g. doctor's certificate)

. . .

-   The course will take place in person

    -   Only for students who are not in Würzburg yet, there is an option via Zoom

. . .

-   We will use these textbooks (Open Educational Resources - freely available online, also linked in WueCampus):

    -   Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century: <https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/index.html>

    -   For the R part: Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis: <https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/>

```{=html}
<!-- -   Should we use MS Teams?

    -   Advantage: You can ask questions and discuss there!

    -   Disadvantage: One more program to use/check...-->
```
::: notes
Online: Participation, videos, chat...

Or R Session on Tuesday and video before? Some can't make it on Wednesdays... (chat or speak out)

Attendance: If 2x per week sync: max. 3 missed classes, if 1x per week: max. 2 missed classes (unless I know your reasons for missing Wednesdays!) --\> if you missed more, I can't admit you for the exam/report

The input and hands-on sessions will be highly based on these two textbooks. You don't need to read the textbooks, but it will of course help if you either read the chapter before or after the sessions: Repetition is always helpful!
:::

## Contents

::: incremental
-   From basic probability to (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models
    -   Some things may be repetitive for you but this course aims to provide a common starting position for your next semesters
-   Input (lecture style) with hands-on R sessions <!-- -   Input could be video based that you should watch before the (R) session -->
-   In addition, you should read a few pages in the text books\
    (<a href="https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/">Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century</a>, and possibly <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/">Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis</a>)
-   Project: Independently analyze a dataset (exam with pass or fail grading)
:::

::: notes
For some, e.g. the psychologists, it will be more of a repetition - but you will also learn R.

Slides might be text heavy --\> so that you can go through the slides afterwards again (but textbook might also be helpful)
:::

## Project

. . .

-   Find a dataset that can answer a question you are interested in

    -   <https://ourworldindata.org/>
    -   <a href="https://www.destatis.de/">Statistisches Bundesamt</a>
    -   Your own, e.g., from an internship

. . .

-   preprocess/wrangle it,

-   analyze the data,

-   and write a short (min. 2-page) report!

    -   short intro incl. research question and hypothesis
    -   methods (both how the data were acquired and how they are analyzed)
    -   results (incl. at least one plot)
    -   and a short discussion.
        -   *All* these parts should be *at least half a page* long.

# Why Statistics?

## Why is it important that YOU know statistics?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   You're doing a *research* master!

    -   Research = Reading & understanding papers (esp. the analyses)
    -   Designing your own experiments, analyze data, interpret results

-   We live in an increasingly data-centric world

    -   Knowing how to wrangle and analyze data is a valuable skill

-   Facts & data literacy matter more than ever!

    -   Fake News, "Lying with stats", Reproducibility Crisis

    -   Being able to call bullshit (<https://www.callingbullshit.org/>)

-   "I only believe in statistics that I doctored myself" ― Winston S. Churchill

    -   However: "It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them" ― Frederick Mosteller
:::

::: notes
break-out session, 3 min.\
--\> Afterwards: write in chat or speak, what did you come up with?

possibly show empirical cycle or the like to indicate that stats are necessary at almost every step
:::

## What is Statistical Thinking?

::: incremental
-   "a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and **use data \[to\] make decisions and predictions**, all in the context of the inherent **uncertainty** that exists in the real world." (Poldrack, Preface of ST21)

-   "Statistical thinking is a way of **understanding** a complex world by describing it in relatively **simple terms** that nonetheless capture **essential aspects** of its structure or function, and that also provide us some idea of how **uncertain** we are about that knowledge." (Poldrack, Chapter 1)
:::

::: notes
break down complexity, include uncertainty
:::

## Why is Statistical Thinking Important?

::: incremental
-   data literacy vs. intuition/heuristics/anecdotal evidence
    -   Public discourse about Covid-19, migration, etc. (e.g., "50% of people in intensive care are vaccinated")
:::

. . .

[![Base Rate Fallacy](images/BaseRate.jpg){fig-align="center" width="600"}](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/base-rate-fallacy)

::: notes
Write in chat! (after first bullet point!)

example availability heuristic from book (or any other example where intuition is wrong, i.e. vaccinations/covid...)

\--\> test in class? Ask for opinion/intuition, show data
:::

## What can Statistics Do For Us?

-   **Describe** patterns by summarizing/breaking down data ("descriptive statistics")

-   **Decide** whether one thing is better than another, given the uncertainty ("inferential statistics")

-   **Predict** how other people would "behave" (generalize to new observations)

::: notes
describe: not useful to look at every single data point/person, but we need s.th. like tendencies/trends...
:::

## The Big Ideas

::: incremental
-   **Learning from data**: Update our beliefs

-   **Aggregation**: How to summarize the data to draw meaningful conclusions?

-   **Uncertainty**: Probabilistic evidence

-   **Sampling from the population**: Which people etc. do we select?
:::

::: notes
ask for every point what I could mean w/ it?

LfD: gather new knowledge

Agg: Can't look at all ind data points, need to find trends etc. (should not go to far! throwing out data)

uncert: stats = tools for making decisions under uncert, we can never prove anything but provide evidence, there is no 100% certainty for an outcome (cancer)

sampling: how do we represent the population? What is the population? how much data do we need? More is better, but payoff decreases...
:::

## Causality

Correlation does not imply causation... but is a hint!

. . .

Example: Smoking = less risk for Parkinson's disease? (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.45.7.577">Godwin-Austen et al., 1982</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181d55f38">Chen et al., 2010</a>)

. . .

\--\> confounding factors?

. . .

e.g., individual dopaminergic activity =\> addiction & motor function

. . .

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) as the solution?

::: notes
give example! Eat more fat = living longer? Confounders (richer people, healthier diets, less stress, better health care...)

RCT: exp control and manipulation, removes confounds if done well\
At least some more causal evidence!

QUESTIONS so far?
:::

## What are Data?

-   What do you think are data?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   qualitative vs. quantitative

    -   qualitative?

        -   open questions, descriptions... can potentially be coded into categories

    -   quantitative?

        -   numeric, can be averaged etc.
:::

::: notes
Chat --\> after showing slide! Come up with examples for "Data"

Collect: Do you have ideas? What are data you encounter in your lives/work etc? What are differences between these data?
:::

## What are Data? (2)

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Data types

    -   character/string: text (qualitative)

    -   factors/categories

    -   types of numbers (quantitative)

        -   binary: 0 or 1, TRUE or FALSE (logical)

        -   integers: whole numbers

        -   real numbers: decimals/fractions

-   discrete vs. continuous

    -   discrete: finite set of particular values (0 or 1, scale from 1 to 10)

    -   continuous: real numbers that fall into particular range (e.g., brain activity, visual analoge scale)

-   What data type is *eye color*?
:::

::: notes
discrete vs. continuous: question for examples or quiz

Further classify data examples mentioned in chat
:::

## What is a Data Set?

-   a collection of data

-   usually organized into rows and columns (like an excel spreadsheet)

    -   rows: participants/animals/cells...

    -   columns: **variables**!

        -   each variable contains one type of measurement

    -   table cells = unique observations of variables per participant etc.

![NHANES dataset](images/Dataset.jpg)

::: notes
possibly go through columns and ask for data types?
:::

## What Makes a Good Measurement?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
<!-- -   Discuss! -->

-   What is being measured?

    -   constructs vs. proxies: need to be well-defined! (Difficult)

    -   measurement error

        -   random: e.g., variation in reaction times of same participant across trials

        -   systematic: e.g., miscalibrated eye-tracking device

-   Do we have a "gold standard" to compare the measurement to?
:::

::: notes
Break-Out session: Brainstorm what makes a good vs. bad measurement!

Group work/brainstorm:

-   What are problems?

-   Which kind of errors/when is data NOT good

-   how can we minimize error?
:::

## Reliability

Correlation of a measurement with "itself"

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Internal reliability (consistency)

-   Test-retest reliability (stability)

-   Inter-rater reliability (agreement)
:::

. . .

Correlation with other variables can't be higher than reliability (cf., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02643294.2012.753433">Wilmer et al., 2012, Table 1</a>)!

## Validity

Are we measuring the construct we're interested in?

::: incremental
-   Face validity: Does it intuitively make sense? First reality check!

-   Construct validity

    -   convergent validity: Related to similar measures that should measure the same construct

    -   divergent validity: Is it unrelated to other measures?

-   Predictive validity: Is it predictive of other outcomes? (e.g., intelligence & job success)
:::

. . .

![Reliability & Validity](images/ReliabilityValidity-1.png){width="400"}

## Summarizing Data

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Throwing away (some of the) information!

    -   extract the quintessence of the data (important for forming *models*)

    -   make predictions

-   Counts, frequencies, percentages, averages
:::

# Thanks! {.scrollable}
