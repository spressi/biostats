Or it may be harder due to diminishing marginal returns (i.e., flatter slope).\n\n\nThis is what we call an interaction: The effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable.\nThus, priorClass can have a main effect on grade (i.e., independent of studyTime): “I already know more, so I don’t need to study”.\nBut it can also interact with studyTime: “Due to my prior knowledge, I can study more efficiently.”"
