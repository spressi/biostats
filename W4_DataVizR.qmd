Why should we visualize our data?

::: incremental
-   check whether data make sense (unusual observations?)

-   honestly and comprehensively present the data

-   (visually) check whether data fits the assumptions of statistical tests
:::

. . .

It's fun! (And plots are probably the most important information in papers!)

## ggplot

We will use a package called `ggplot2` (which is part of the tidyverse). ggplot2 is a very versatile package and allows us to make beautiful figure, which are immediately ready for publication.

The main function to "start" plotting is `ggplot()` - we will then add layers of data and layers to tweak the appearance.

![Layers of a ggplot](images/ggplotlayers.PNG){fig-alt="Depiction of how a plot is built up from different layers in ggplot2" width="502"}

## Activity 1: Set Up

1.  Open RStudio and load your Biostats R project. Create a new script called `DataVisualisation1.R`.

2.  Make sure you have the following two files downloaded into your project folder (we already used them in Intro to R presentation): [`ahi-cesd.csv`](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/ahi-cesd.csv) and [`participant-info.csv`](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/participant-info.csv).

3.  Copy and run the code below to load the `tidyverse` package and the data files:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| 
library(tidyverse) 

dat <- read_csv("ahi-cesd.csv")
pinfo <- read_csv("participant-info.csv")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
library(tidyverse) 

dat <- read_csv("Data/ahi-cesd.csv")
pinfo <- read_csv("Data/participant-info.csv")
```

4.  Run the following code to combine both files and select our variables of interest:

```{r}
#| echo: true
all_dat <- dat %>% inner_join(pinfo, 
                              by=c("id", "intervention")) %>% 
  arrange(id, occasion) #joining messes up the order of the data frame => arrange again

#we throw out several variables even though they would be important for a comprehensive data analysis
summarydata <- all_dat %>% select(id, ahiTotal, cesdTotal, #ID & questionnaire scores
                                  sex, age, educ, income) #demographic variables
```

::: notes
what happens in the code chunk?
:::

## Look at the Data

Have a look at the types of data:

```{r}
#| echo: true
glimpse(summarydata)
```

What do you see?

. . .

All variables are loaded as numeric. However, are all of those numeric?

. . .

`sex`, `educ` and `income` don't seem to really be numbers but **factors** with individual categories (factor **levels**)! \
We should convert these data to factor. Checking and adjusting data types (as part of data wrangling) will be important for plotting and analyzing the data, you might otherwise get strange/wrong results!

## Activity 2: Transform Data Type

Copy and run the below code to change the categories to factors.

-   So for example, the 1s in `sex` change to categorical factors instead of numerical 1s.

-   If you mutate a new column with the same name as the old one, it will overwrite the column.

-   You can read each line of the mutate as "overwrite the data that is in that column with the same values now considered factors and not doubles"

```{r}
#| echo: true
summarydata1 <- summarydata %>%
  mutate(sex = as_factor(sex),
         educ = as_factor(educ),
         income = as_factor(income))

glimpse(summarydata1)
summarydata1 %>% pull(educ) %>% unique()
```

## Transform Data Type 2

A simple change to a factor is not always helpful. We still don't know what a `1` in `sex` or a `5` in `educ` stands for:

:::aside
There is very sparse information on the variables at <https://doi.org/10.5334/jopd.35>, so I guesstimated some of the factor levels.
:::

-   `sex`: 1 = *female*, 2 = *male*

-   `educ`: 1 = *no graduation*, 2 = *school graduation*, 3 = *vocational training*, 4 = *bachelor's degree*, 5 = *post graduate*

-   `income`: 1 = *low*, 2 = *middle*, 3 = *high*

```{r}
#| echo: true
summarydata2 = summarydata1 %>% mutate(sex = sex %>% recode("1" = "female", "2" = "male"),
                                       educ = educ %>% recode("1" = "no graduation",
                                                              "2" = "school graduation",
                                                              "3" = "vocational training",
                                                              "4" = "bachelor's degree",
                                                              "5" = "post grad"),
                                       income = income %>% recode("1" = "low",
                                                                  "2" = "middle",
                                                                  "3" = "high"))

#glimpse(summarydata2)
summarydata2 %>% pull(educ) %>% unique()
```

## Transform Data Type 3

`recode()` only works with data that are already factors. What if we start with the original data (i.e., `summarydata` instead of `summarydata1`)?

```{r}
#| echo: true
# no factors yet => refer to original data as numbers WITHOUT quotation marks
summarydata3 = summarydata %>% mutate(sex = if_else(sex==1, "female", "male") %>% as_factor(), #could also use case_match
                       educ = educ %>% case_match(1 ~ "no graduation",
                                                  2 ~ "school graduation",
                                                  3 ~ "vocational training",
                                                  4 ~ "bachelor's degree",
                                                  5 ~ "post grad") %>% as_factor(),
                       income = income %>% case_match(1 ~ "low", 2 ~ "middle", 3 ~ "high") %>% as_factor())

#glimpse(summarydata3)
summarydata3 %>% pull(educ) %>% unique()
```

. . .

Factor is now ordered by occurrence in data! :(

. . .

-   If data are **factors coded as numbers**, do `as_factor()` first and then `recode()`
-   If data are **factors coded as characters**, make sure that the ordering is correct (use `arrange()` for alphabetical order) or create a new `factor()` with explicit ordering: `income %>% factor(levels=c("low", "middle", "high"))`)

# Activity 3: Barplot

A bar plot is a plot that shows counts of categorical data (factors), where the height of each bar represents the count of that variable.

We will plot male and female participants.

## The First Layer

-   The first line (or layer) sets up the base of the graph: the data to use and the aesthetics (what will go on the x and y axis, how the plot will be grouped).

-   `aes()` can take both an `x` and `y` argument, however, with a bar plot you are just asking R to plot the number of data points in each group onto the y-axis, so you do not specify `y` here.

```{r}
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| echo: true
ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex))
```

## The Second Layer

The next layer adds a **geom** or a shape. In this case we use `geom_bar()` as we want to draw a bar plot.

-   Note that we are adding layers, using a [`+`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html) between layers. This is a very important difference between pipes and visualization.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## The Second Layer with color

-   Adding `fill` to the first layer will separate the data into each level of the grouping variable and give it a different color. In this case, there is a different colored bar for each level of `sex`.

-   We can get rid of the (in this case redundant legend) with `show.legend = FALSE`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar() #geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE)
```

## The Next Layers - Improving the Plot

We might want to make the plot a bit prettier and easier to read. What would you improve?

. . .

We might want to add better axis labels and change the colors of the bars. We can do so with the functions `scale_x_discrete()` and `scale_y_continuous()`, which will adjust the x and y axes.

We will use these two arguments in those functions:

-   `name` controls/overwrites the axis name (e.g. Groups)

-   `labels` controls the break points on the axis, i.e. what are the conditions called? The order is important here!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "3,4|5"
ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex", 
                   labels = c("Female", "Male")) + #if we didn't set factor labels, we can do here manually (not recommended!)
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants")
```

::: notes
There's also the counterparts `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_discrete()`. What do you think, why do we use the ones mentioned above and when would we use the other ones?
:::

## Themes: Changing the Appearance

There are a number of built-in themes that you can use to change the appearance (background, whether axes are shown etc.), but you can also tweak the themes further manually.

We will now change the default theme to `theme_minimal()`, but you can also try other themes (just type "theme\_" and see what the autocomplete brings up).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(summarydata2, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) + #now with summarydata2
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex") + #no need to set labels
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Colors

There are various ways to change the colors of the bars. You can manually indicate the colors you want to use but you can also easily use pre-determined color palettes that are already checked for color-blind friendliness.

A popular palette is **viridis**. We can simply add a function/layer to your ggplot named `scale_fill_viridis_d()` (d for discrete). The function has an *option* parameter that takes 5 different values (A - E).

-   Type and run the below code into a new code chunk. Try changing the option to either A, B, C or D and see which one you like!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "7"

ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex", 
                   labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")

```

## Transparency

You can also add transparency to your plot, which can be helpful if you plot several layers of data.

To do so, you can simply add `alpha` to the `geom_bar()`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "3"

ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE, 
           alpha = .8) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex", 
                   labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")

```

## Grouped Plots

Let's go back to the bar plot (but works similarly for other plots as well): Imagine that you have several *factors* that you want to use to group your data, such as gender and income. In this case, you could use a **grouped bar plot**:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2"

ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = sex, fill = income)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", #prevents "stacked" barplots
           show.legend = TRUE, 
           alpha = .8) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex", 
                   labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")
```

:::notes
Without `position = dodge`, you would get a stacked barplot
:::

## Facetting

You could also use **facets** to divide your data visualizations into several subplots: `facet_wrap` for one variable.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "8"

ggplot(summarydata2, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE, 
           alpha = .8) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")  +
  facet_wrap(vars(income)) #in this function, you need to use vars() around variable names
```

:::notes
What is problematic here? We needed percentages for females and males for a better comparison
:::

## Facetting 2

You could also use **facets** to divide your data visualizations into several subplots: `facet_grid` for a matrix of (combinations of) two variables.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "8-10"

ggplot(summarydata2, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE, 
           alpha = .8) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Participant Sex") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")  +
  facet_grid(rows=vars(income), 
             cols=vars(educ),
             labeller = "label_both") #this adds the variable name into the facet legends
```

# Activity 4: The Violin-Boxplot

There are a number of different figure types you can plot with the different geoms, e.g. `geom_point()`, `geom_histogram()`, `geom_line()`...

We now want to plot a form of a boxplot that becomes more popular: The violin-boxplot (which combines, i.e. overlays, the violin plot with a boxplot).

## Violin-Boxplot

Let's look at the code. How does the code differ from the one for the barplot above?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|4|7"

ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = income, 
                        y = ahiTotal, #new variable!
                        fill = income)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, #smooth on edges
              show.legend = FALSE, 
              alpha = .4) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .2, #small boxplot contained in violin
               show.legend = FALSE, 
               alpha = .7)+
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Income",
                   labels = c("Below Average", 
                              "Average", 
                              "Above Average")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Authentic Happiness Inventory Score")+
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

::: notes
In this case, not the **count** on the y-axis, but another cont. variable!
:::

## Layer Order

The order of layers is crucial, as the plot will be built up in that order (later layers on **top**):

::: columns
::: column
```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = income, y = ahiTotal)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::

::: column
```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = income, y = ahiTotal)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_violin() 
```
:::
:::

## Scatterplot

If we have continuous data of two variables, we often want to make a **scatter plot**:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2|5"

ggplot(summarydata1, aes(x = age, y = cesdTotal)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) # if you don't want the shaded CI, add se = FALSE to this

```

## Saving your Figures

You can use `ggsave()` to save your plots. If you don't tell `ggsave()` which plot you want to save, by default it will save **the last plot you created**.

You just have to enter the name of the file to be saved (in your working directory) like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggsave("violin-boxplot.png")
```

Check whether indeed the last plot was saved!

. . .

\

You can also specify the dimensions of your plot to be saved:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggsave("violin-boxplot.png",
       width = 6.5, #width of a typical page in inches minus border (according to APA format)
       height = 6.5 / sqrt(2), #golden ratio :)
       units = "in")
```
or
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggsave("violin-boxplot.png",
       width = 1920,
       height = 1080,
       units = "px") #full HD picture in pixels: 1920 x 1080
```

## Saving your Figures 2

You can also assign the plot to a variable in your environment (just like we did with the tibbles previously) and then tell `ggsave()` which object to save. This is a bit safer.

Run the code for the violin-boxplot again and save the plot in an object called `viobox`. You'd then have to explicitly tell `ggsave()` to save the object `viobox`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1,20"

viobox <- summarydata1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = income,
             y = ahiTotal,
             fill = income)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, 
              show.legend = FALSE, 
              alpha = .4) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .2, 
               show.legend = FALSE, 
               alpha = .7) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Income",
                   labels = c("Below Average", 
                              "Average", 
                              "Above Average")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Authentic Happiness Inventory Score")+
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()


ggsave("violin-boxplot-stored.png", plot = viobox)
```

::: notes
Do not add `ggsave()` to the plot with a `+`. Instead run it on a separate line!

If plot is assigned to object, it won't be displayed unless you type `viobox` in the console!
